## About Me  
Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Computer Engineering student at Politecnico di Torino, interested in DevOps, cloud, and software development. I enjoy understanding how systems work end to end and using tools like Python, Linux, Git, and Docker to build, deploy, and improve applications. Right now I am learning more about cloud services, CI/CD, and automation, and I like working on small projects to practice what I study. Looking for internships and entry-level roles where I can grow my skills, work in a team, and contribute to real engineering projects.

Here you’ll find:  
- Academic projects in AI, Machine Learning.  
- Personal experiments with new frameworks, tools, and programming languages  
- Collaborative contributions to open-source and research-driven initiatives  

I believe in learning by doing, staying adaptable, and delivering clean, well-documented code.
